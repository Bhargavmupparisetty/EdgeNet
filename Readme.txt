README for EdgeNet-X Minimal Dataset
-------------------------------------

This archive contains the minimal dataset, model weights, and inference script necessary to reproduce the core results of the manuscript titled:

"EdgeNet-X: An Edge-Optimized Model for Airport Detection"

Contents:
- Pretrained model (model/airport_detection.pth)
- Inference and evaluation script (inference.py)
- Sample test images and annotations (sample_data/)
- metadata.txt describing data variables and format

Instructions:
1. Run `inference.py` using sample images to verify model predictions.
2. Check evaluation metrics for output matching the paper's reported mAP and AR.
